## Description
This React web app loads randomly generated users into a table that displays their photo, name, email, phone number, and date of birth. The user can sort the table alphabetically by name. The search bar loads the user's search in real time and displays only the employees that match their keystrokes. Finally, this application is deployed using heroku.
